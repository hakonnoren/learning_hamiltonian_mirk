# Learning Hamiltonian Systems with Mono-Implicit Runge–Kutta Methods


This repository with code for the paper "Learning Hamiltonian Systems with Mono-Implicit Runge–Kutta Methods"

The code contains numerical experiments learning the Hamiltonian of the chaotic double pendulum in addition to the Fermi–Pasta–Ulam-Tsingou system from data.
