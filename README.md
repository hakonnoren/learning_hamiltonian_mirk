# Learning Hamiltonian Systems with Mono-Implicit Runge–Kutta Methods


This repository contains code for the paper "Learning Hamiltonian Systems with Mono-Implicit Runge–Kutta Methods"

The code implements numerical experiments learning the Hamiltonian of the chaotic double pendulum in addition to the Fermi–Pasta–Ulam-Tsingou system from data.


The initial state optimization in `utils/iso_objective.py` is a modification of the implementation of ISO from the following repository https://github.com/zhengdao-chen/SRNN/ (CC-BY-NC 4.0 license).
